# autoresearch

This is a distribution router for an upstream skill package. Use it when the user explicitly selects this suite.
Read the relevant original SKILL.md below before doing the task. Keep its invocation policies, workflow, and attribution.
Resolve resources relative to that original skill file. The upstream directory layout is preserved under upstream/.
Host-specific hooks, commands, MCP servers, subagents, and local browser sessions are prerequisites, not capabilities installed by this router.
Use absolute paths to packaged helper scripts. Do not confuse the upstream resource directory with the user project or output directory.

## Skills

- autoresearch: [original instructions](upstream/0-autoresearch-skill/SKILL.md) — Orchestrates end-to-end autonomous AI research projects using a two-loop architecture. The inner loop runs rapid experiment iterations with clear optimization targets. The outer loop synthesizes results, identifies patterns, and steers research direction. Routes to domain-specific skills for execution, supports continuous agent operation via Claude Code /loop and OpenClaw heartbeat, and produces research presentations and papers. Use when starting a research project, running autonomous experiments, or managing a multi-hypothesis research effort.

## Requirements

- 具体训练、推理或实验技能需要各自框架及计算资源
